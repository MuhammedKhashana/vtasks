As a frontend developer you can't get your app to the live without backend, so this is problem for us specially when we are in stage of implementation what we learned.

So, I learned FIREBASE.
Firebase gives me most of the features that I will need from the backend to get my app alive.

I'm happy to share with you my first app with firebase TO-DO APP

In my app you can create your own account with your email and login later or you can do it with Google, then You will receive email to verify your account, in case you forgot password on login you can reset it by sending you email finally you can logout. 
ðŸ”´ if you logged with your GOOGLE account you will not be able to reset email or password because this isn't existing data, to be able to do that you have to sign up with the same email and create password

You have all control about your profile,
You can edit your Name or Image or update your email or password.

- I have used multiple libraries for the design to make it simple and easy for navigation between profile control and tasks list so I hope you like it

Features of the app
- You can add task in the main list and description for it (optional) and you can edit it or mark it as completed task to go to the completed tasks list where you can delete it or call it back as uncompleted task

- You can create new list for example weekly or monthly Tasks and you can edit its name later and adding your tasks which have the same features that we are talking about above then you can delete the list if you want


In the development side I used Firebase as I said but used it with Redux-Toolkit completely the same way if I use API, in case in the future this app will be dependent on API It will be very easy to do this operation.


The APP is available now you can use it: https://lnkd.in/dxw-W-9i
